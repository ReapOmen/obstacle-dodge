# obstacle-dodge
This is my first game in C++.  
I am using Cocos2d-x to implement a simple obstacle dodger.  
Because this is my first game, I am trying to create my own physics instead of using Box2D.  

Here is a short list of things implemented so far:  
 * Moveable ball that centers itself 
 * Moving obstacles that fall towards the ball
 * Randomized obstacle creation
 * Collision detection which resets score
 
TODO:  
 * Main menu screen
 * Pause screen
 * Game over screen
 *
